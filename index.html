        <h2>About Winnie</h2>
        <p> Winnie-the-Pooh is a fictional anthropomorphic teddy bear created by English author A. A. Milne and English illustrator E. H. Shepard.<br />
            Winnie-the-Pooh first appeared by name in a children's story commissioned by London's Evening News for Christmas Eve 1925.<br />
            The character is inspired by a stuffed toy that Milne had bought for his son Christopher Robin in Harrods department store, <br />
            and a bear they had viewed at London Zoo. Winnie-the-Pooh first appeared by name in a children's story commissioned by London's <br />
